# Lask, Where Ladies Ask

## DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that I've learned in the past month together! For my first project I will use my knowledge of front and back-end web development (it's so exciting that I have knowledge of this!) to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. The type of web application I create is my choice.

The objective of this project is to:

* Apply the skills I've learned by building a web application from the ground up.
* Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.

I will be working **individually** for this first project.

## WHAT THE APP IS

Lask, where ladies ask!

StackOverflow is male dominated, as is the tech community in general. During my research on SO, I encountered a problem with the community. There is a lack of women on [SO](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/30411/what-can-stack-overflow-do-to-persuade-female-programmers-to-participate-more) and one of the comments actually says 'Perhaps some occupations, like IT, are simply not a woman's job? Strippers are mostly women. So what? Why do women complain they don't get into IT?'. On top of that, women who code are told things like 'you need to go back to playing with my Barbie dolls' (Heather, SO), and their contributions are valued much less than men's, that is, valued by who made them, not their worth, with misogynistic comments being tolerated everyday.

 This pushes women away because they are made to feel inferior to men, and less important than men. Women need a place to ask and answer questions in a community where they feel safe and judgement-free. This inspired my site, which is like StackOverflow-but for Women! Enjoy :)

## HOW DOES MY APP WORK

* **Express API** I implemented a backend Express API that serves up an html page(s) and a JSON API.
* **RESTful Routes** Designed the routes in a [RESTful](http://restfulrouting.com/mappings/resources) manner.
* **MongoDB** Persisted three models in a Mongo Database.
* **AJAX** Leveraged the backend API to fetch JSON asynchronously to the client.
* **jQuery** Used jQuery to manipulate the DOM and data on the client-side.
* **Templating** Backend templating with EJS and rendered the JSON data on the frontend using underscore templates.
* **Authentication** Enable users to signup, login, and logout.
* **Data Validation** Validated data by handling incorrect inputs during sign up (currently redirects to signup page if error occurs), with a unique username.
* **Model Relationship** Created a `has_many` relationship between the User, Questions, and Answers using embedded data.
* **Visual Design** Used Twitter Bootstrap and local CSS files to beautify the front-end.
* **Heroku** Deployed code to Heroku without exposing any secret keys.
* **Cookies** Added a cookie for every user session.

## COMING SOON...

* **External API** Enable users to sign up through Facebook and Twitter.
* **Authorization** Disallow users from CRUDing content in other users' profiles (NO ACCESS FOR YOU).
* **Profile Update** Users will be able to have a profile picture, an awesome profile page, a bio, and a section for favorite languages and libraries.
* **And more...**
