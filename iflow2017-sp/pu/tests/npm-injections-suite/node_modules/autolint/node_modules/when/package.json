  "readme": "Please Note: this project has moved from briancavalier/when to cujojs/when.\nAny existing forks have been automatically moved to cujojs/when. However,\nyou'll need to update your clone and submodule remotes manually.\n\nUpdate the url in your .git/config, and also .gitmodules for submodules:\n\n```\ngit://github.com/cujojs/when.git\nhttps://cujojs@github.com/cujojs/when.git\n```\n\nHelpful link for updating submodules:\n[Git Submodules: Adding, Using, Removing, Updating](http://chrisjean.com/2009/04/20/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/)\n\n----\n\nA lightweight [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) [Promises/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A) and `when()` implementation.  It also provides several other useful Promise-related concepts, such as joining and chaining, and has a robust unit test suite.\n\nIt's **just over 1k** when compiled with Google Closure (w/advanced optimizations) and gzipped.\n\nwhen.js was derived from the async core of [wire.js](https://github.com/cujojs/wire).\n\nWhat's New?\n===========\n\n### 1.0.2\n\n* Updated README for running unit tests in both Node and Browsers.  See **Running the Unit Tests** below.\n* Set package name to 'when' in package.json\n\n### 1.0.1\n\n* Fix for rejections propagating in some cases when they shouldn't have been ([#19](https://github.com/cujojs/when/issues/19))\n* Using [buster.js](http://busterjs.org/) for unit tests now.\n\n### 1.0.0\n\n* First official when.js release as a part of [cujojs](https://github.com/cujojs).\n* Added [when/cancelable](https://github.com/cujojs/when/wiki/when-cancelable) decorator for creating cancelable deferreds\n* Added [when/delay](https://github.com/cujojs/when/wiki/when-delay) and [when/timeout](https://github.com/cujojs/when/wiki/when-timeout) helpers for creating delayed promises and promises that timeout and reject if not resolved first.\n\n### 0.11.1\n\n* Added [when/apply](https://github.com/cujojs/when/wiki/when-apply) helper module for using arguments-based and variadic callbacks with `when.all`, `when.some`, `when.map`, or any promise that resolves to an array. ([#14](https://github.com/cujojs/when/issues/14))\n* `.then()`, `when()`, and all other methods that accept callback/errback/progress handlers will throw if you pass something that's not a function. ([#15](https://github.com/cujojs/when/issues/15))\n\n### 0.11.0\n\n* `when.js` now *assimilates* thenables that pass the [Promises/A duck-type test](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A), but which may not be fully Promises/A compliant, such as [jQuery's Deferred](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/) and [curl's global API](https://github.com/cujojs/curl) (See the **API at a glance** section)\n    * `when()`, and `when.all/some/any/map/reduce/chain()` are all now guaranteed to return a fully Promises/A compliant promise, even when their input is not compliant.\n    * Any non-compliant thenable returned by a callback or errback will also be assimilated to protect subsequent promises and callbacks in a promise chain, and preserve Promises/A forwarding guarantees.\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/cujojs/when/wiki/Changelog)\n\nDocs & Examples\n===============\n\nSee the API section below, and the [wiki for more detailed docs](https://github.com/cujojs/when/wiki) and [examples](https://github.com/cujojs/when/wiki/Examples)\n\nAPI\n===\n\nwhen()\n------\n\nRegister a handler for a promise or immediate value:\n\n```javascript\nwhen(promiseOrValue, callback, errback, progressback)\n\n// Always returns a promise, so can be chained:\n\nwhen(promiseOrValue, callback, errback, progressback).then(anotherCallback, anotherErrback, anotherProgressback)\n```\n\nwhen.defer()\n------------\n\nCreate a new Deferred containing separate `promise` and `resolver` parts:\n\n```javascript\nvar deferred = when.defer();\n\nvar promise = deferred.promise;\nvar resolver = deferred.resolver;\n```\n\nThe deferred has the full `promise` + `resolver` API:\n\n```javascript\ndeferred.then(callback, errback, progressback);\ndeferred.resolve(value);\ndeferred.reject(reason);\ndeferred.progress(update);\n```\n\nThe `promise` API:\n\n```javascript\n// var promise = deferred.promise;\npromise.then(callback, errback, progressback);\n```\n\nThe `resolver` API:\n\n```javascript\n// var resolver = deferred.resolver;\nresolver.resolve(value);\nresolver.reject(err);\nresolver.progress(update);\n```\n\nwhen.isPromise()\n----------------\n\n```javscript\nvar is = when.isPromise(anything);\n```\n\nReturn true if `anything` is truthy and implements the then() promise API.  Note that this will return true for both a deferred (i.e. `when.defer()`), and a `deferred.promise` since both implement the promise API.\n\n\nwhen.some()\n-----------\n\n```javascript\nwhen.some(promisesOrValues, howMany, callback, errback, progressback)\n```\n\nReturn a promise that will resolve when `howMany` of the supplied `promisesOrValues` have resolved.  The resolution value of the returned promise will be an array of length `howMany` containing the resolutions values of the triggering `promisesOrValues`.\n\nwhen.all()\n----------\n\n```javascript\nwhen.all(promisesOrValues, callback, errback, progressback)\n```\n\nReturn a promise that will resolve only once *all* the supplied `promisesOrValues` have resolved.  The resolution value of the returned promise will be an array containing the resolution values of each of the `promisesOrValues`.\n\nwhen.any()\n----------\n\n```javascript\nwhen.any(promisesOrValues, callback, errback, progressback)\n```\n\nReturn a promise that will resolve when any one of the supplied `promisesOrValues` has resolved.  The resolution value of the returned promise will be the resolution value of the triggering `promiseOrValue`.\n\nwhen.chain()\n------------\n\n```javascript\nwhen.chain(promiseOrValue, resolver, optionalValue)\n```\n\nEnsure that resolution of `promiseOrValue` will complete `resolver` with the completion value of `promiseOrValue`, or instead with `optionalValue` if it is provided.\n\nReturns a new promise that will complete when `promiseOrValue` is completed, with the completion value of `promiseOrValue`, or instead with `optionalValue` if it is provided.\n\n**Note:** If `promiseOrValue` is not an immediate value, it can be anything that supports the promise API (i.e. `then()`), so you can pass a `deferred` as well.  Similarly, `resolver` can be anything that supports the resolver API (i.e. `resolve()`, `reject()`), so a `deferred` will work there, too.\n\nwhen.map()\n----------\n\n```javascript\nwhen.map(promisesOrValues, mapFunc)\n```\n\nTraditional map function, similar to `Array.prototype.map()`, but allows input to contain promises and/or values, and mapFunc may return either a value or a promise.\n\nThe map function should have the signature:\n\n```javascript\nmapFunc(item)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `item` is a fully resolved value of a promise or value in `promisesOrValues`\n\nwhen.reduce()\n-------------\n\n```javascript\nwhen.reduce(promisesOrValues, reduceFunc, initialValue)\n```\n\nTraditional reduce function, similar to `Array.prototype.reduce()`, but input may contain promises and/or values, and reduceFunc may return either a value or a promise, *and* initialValue may be a promise for the starting value.\n\nThe reduce function should have the signature:\n\n```javascript\nreduceFunc(currentValue, nextItem, index, total)\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n* `currentValue` is the current accumulated reduce value\n* `nextItem` is the fully resolved value of the promise or value at `index` in `promisesOrValues`\n* `index` the *basis* of `nextItem` ... practically speaking, this is the array index of the promiseOrValue corresponding to `nextItem`\n* `total` is the total number of items in `promisesOrValues`\n\nwhen/apply\n----------\n\n```javascript\nfunction functionThatAcceptsMultipleArgs(array) {\n    // ...\n}\n\nvar functionThatAcceptsAnArray = apply(functionThatAcceptsMultipleArgs);\n```\n\nHelper that allows using callbacks that take multiple args, instead of an array, with `when.all/some/map`:\n\n```javascript\nwhen.all(arrayOfPromisesOrValues, apply(functionThatAcceptsMultipleArgs));\n```\n\n[See the wiki](https://github.com/cujojs/when/wiki/when-apply) for more info and examples.\n\nRunning the Unit Tests\n======================\n\nInstall [buster.js](http://busterjs.org/)\n\n`npm install -g buster`\n\nRun unit tests in Node:\n\n1. `buster test -e node`\n\nRun unit tests in Browsers (and Node):\n\n1. `buster server` - this will print a url\n2. Point browsers at <buster server url>/capture, e.g. `localhost:1111/capture`\n3. `buster test` or `buster test -e browser`\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nMuch of this code was inspired by @[unscriptable](https://github.com/unscriptable)'s [tiny promises](https://github.com/unscriptable/promises), the async innards of [wire.js](https://github.com/cujojs/wire), and some gists [here](https://gist.github.com/870729), [here](https://gist.github.com/892345), [here](https://gist.github.com/894356), and [here](https://gist.github.com/894360)\n\nSome of the code has been influenced by the great work in [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q), [Dojo's Deferred](https://github.com/dojo/dojo), and [uber.js](https://github.com/phiggins42/uber.js).\n",
