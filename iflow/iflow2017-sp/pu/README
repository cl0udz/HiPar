All scripts are executed from the current directory.

1. For running the basic tests:

./scripts/run_basic_tests.sh

2. Run iterative tests:

./scripts/run_iterative_tests.sh ITERATIVE_TESTS_DIR [ -i TRACE_INTERPRETER] [-v] [-e2e]

- v option specifies that the counted flows should be checked against an assertion file that should be available in the tests dir.
- e2e option specifies that only end-2-end flows should be counted

e.g. ./scripts/run_iterative_tests.sh ./tests/iterativeEnd2End/ -i ./src/js/analysis/TraceInterpreter.js -v -e2e

3. Run flow types study.

  i) Online part:
./scripts/run_study_online.sh BENCHMARK_DIR

e.g. ./scripts/run_study_online.sh tests/original-sunspider_subset/

It creates a new directory in "results" and writes the traces into it.

 ii) Offline part:
 ./scripts/run_study_offline.sh RESULTS_DIR [-i TRACE_INTERPRETER] [-e2e]

e.g., ./scripts/run_study_offline.sh results/original-sunspider_subset_1429084531
