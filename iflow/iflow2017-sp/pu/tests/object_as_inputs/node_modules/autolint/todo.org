* Todo [4/10]
** DONE Avoid errors because of too many open files
** TODO Dont bundle jslint or jshint, but fetch them with npm
   - requires some loading magic for jslint, since Crockford refuses
     to make jslint node-friendly.
** TODO Look for changes in directories using some watch lib
** TODO Create plugin for js2-mode.el that sets global-externs
** DONE Suggest random new files to clean
** DONE Use when.js instead of buster-promise
** TODO Being blamed for introducing an error, AND praised for fixing it,
   when changing around whitespace (changes line numbers)
** TODO Keep getting "nice cleanup!" in a file with too many errors
** DONE Files with more than 50 errors are reported as having 52 errors.
** TODO Switching git branches can be spammy, any way around that?
