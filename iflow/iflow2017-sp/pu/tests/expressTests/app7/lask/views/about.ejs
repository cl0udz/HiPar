    <h1>Join Lask, where<span class="pink"> ladies ask</span>.</h1><br>
    <p>StackOverflow is male dominated, as is the tech community in general. During my research on SO, I encountered a problem with the community. There is a lack of women on <a class ="pink" href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/30411/what-can-stack-overflow-do-to-persuade-female-programmers-to-participate-more">SO</a> and one of the comments actually says "Perhaps some occupations, like IT, are simply not a woman's job? Strippers are mostly women. So what? Why do women complain they don't get into IT?".
    <br><br>On top of that, women who code are told things like "you need to go back to playing with my Barbie dolls" (Heather, SO), and their contributions are valued much less than men's, that is, valued by who made them, not their worth, with misogynistic comments being tolerated everyday.<br><br>
    This pushes women away because they are made to feel inferior to men, and less important than men. Women need a place to ask and answer questions in a community where they feel safe and judgement-free. This inspired my site, which is like StackOverflow-but for women! Here, women can finally feel comfortable asking and answering technical questions, and build a strong community of women coders.<br><br>Why us? Because women need a safe place to ask and answer questions too.<br><br></p><br><br>
