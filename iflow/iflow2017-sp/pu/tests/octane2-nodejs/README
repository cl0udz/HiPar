Changes wrt original Octane 2 benchmarks:
 - Execute benchmark code only a single time (no warm up, no repetitions) by calling the setup(), run(), and tearDown() functions of the benchmark.
 - Beautified source code (with js-beautify) of minified benchmarks, e.g., box2d.
 - Merged gbemu-part1 and gbemu-part2 into a single file and run everything in non-strict mode.
 - Removed performance measurement code from mandreel and splay.
 - Copied typescript-input.js and typescript-compiler.js into typescript.js.
 - Copied zlib-data.js into zlib.js.



Open problems:
 These benchmarks currently throw an exception, need to investigate why:
 - code-load.js
 - pdfjs.js
 - zlib.js
 Out of memory during policy seeding
 - mandreel.js
